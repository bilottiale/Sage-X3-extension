Local Char CUSTOMER(15)
Local Char CUSTOMERNAME(35)
Local Decimal AMOUNT
Local Date CREATEDATE

$# Test 1: Table autocomplete in bracket notation
$# Type: Read [BPC and see suggestions for BPCUSTOMER, BPCSUPPLIER, etc.

$# Test 2: Field autocomplete after table reference
Read [BPCUSTOMER]
If fstat = 0
    $# Type: BPCUSTOMER.BPC and see field suggestions
    CUSTOMER = BPCUSTOMER.BPCNUM
    CUSTOMERNAME = BPCUSTOMER.BPCNAM
    
    $# Test 3: Context-aware suggestions in different statements
    For [BPCUSTOMER] Where BPCTYP = "CUS"
        Write [BPCINVOICE] Using
            BPCINVOICE.BPCNUM = BPCUSTOMER.BPCNUM
            BPCINVOICE.AMOUNT = AMOUNT
            BPCINVOICE.CREATEDATE = date$
        End_for
    Next
End

$# Test 4: Transaction context
Trbegin BPCUSTOMER
    Write [BPCUSTOMER] Using
        BPCUSTOMER.BPCNUM = CUSTOMER
        BPCUSTOMER.BPCNAM = CUSTOMERNAME
    Commit
End

$# Test 5: Complex queries with multiple tables
Local Char SUPPLIER(15)
Read [BPCSUPPLIER] First Where BPCSTA = "A"
If fstat = 0
    $# Should suggest BPCSUPPLIER fields when typing BPCSUPPLIER.
    SUPPLIER = BPCSUPPLIER.BPCNUM
End

$# Test 6: Nested table operations
For [ITMMASTER] Where ITMREF Like "ITEM%"
    $# Should suggest ITMMASTER fields
    If ITMMASTER.ITMSTA = "A"
        Read [ITMSALES] Using ITMMASTER.ITMREF
        If fstat = 0
            $# Should suggest ITMSALES fields
            AMOUNT = ITMSALES.SALFCY
        End
    End
Next

$# 2. BPCUSTOMER.BPC| should show field completions  
$# 3. Context detection should work in Read, Write, For statements
